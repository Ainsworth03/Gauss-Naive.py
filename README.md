# Gauss-Naive.py
This is a code for approximate solution of linear equation system using gauss-naive method

Gauss-Naive Method is pretty good for approximating solution of linear eq system and also the method is pretty simple.
Yet it has a drawbacks that is the iteration might be not convergent and so the iteration will continue and not stopping

Gauss-Pivoting method can be use to cover this shortcoming.

This code is originally made by me and it could still have some bugs and need some improvement(s), feel free to edit or use this code, and also tell me if u find or even had fixed the bug thanks!
This code mostly written in bahasa.

=============================================================================================================

To use : 
1. After u run it, it will asks how many variables that your linear eq system has
2. it'll ask you to input the coefficient's of each variables in each equation
3. Variables will assign as x1, x2, ... , xn where n is max number of variable.

To improve :
if you input the wrong coefficient, you need to start over the program
